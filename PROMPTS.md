Can you redesign the index.html so it is an event planner assitant. Keep the orange but make it dark theme and a more relaxed design

Can you search the documentation at https://developers.cloudflare.com/agents/ for better context. I want to develop an event planner app

How do I create an agent

WHen the AI has generated an event plan, can you detect that it has generated a plan (has ``` marking) and display in the chat window an option for the user to send to slack or not

Can you search the documentation at https://developers.cloudflare.com/agents/guides/slack-agent/. When the agent displays the chat window and the user agrees, the event planner can send the details of the event to slack. Assume that you have the configs e.g slack api key

Can you search the documentation at https://developers.cloudflare.com/agents/api-reference/browse-the-web/. Wehn the user asks the agent to browse the web for links e.g for booking a ticket, the agent should browse the web and return the results 

Can you generate me a read me file describing this project. Include details of how to start as well as the features such as slack integration, browser search etc..
